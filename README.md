Central High School

Keller, Tx

The CHS School app is an app that is built specifically for the students here at CHS. To login to the app the user must login with their SCHOOL EMAIL and password, the sign-in with google feature is currently being worked on as it requires the cooperation of the district in order to provide google sign-in services to the @kellerisd.com domain that the students use for their school email. Once in the app, students have the option to upload an image of their schedule which they can then reference everytime they open the app. Users can also take a look at the district calendar that is full of important district and events that are exclusive to CHS. There is an extracurriculars pages that provides links that have information on all of the clubs and organizations that are here at CHS. There is also an email feature where the students can email a teacher from inside the app, however, this is not fully integrated because the @kellerisd.com domain doesn't accept emails from unrecognized domains, so the app leads students to the gmail app. Through the use of toast messages, the CHS School App is error free and provides users with a bug reporting system if they can't login, register, or upload an image.
